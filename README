Basic http tunneling proxy for giphy api.

# Usage

Run the project with `./gradlew run` from the root of the project. It will
listen on port 1080 for proxy requests. Test with the `test-giphy.sh` script.

# Dependencies

Developed for Java 8, using openjdk version "1.8.0_252".

# TODO
- use SSL for client<->proxy connection (use a self-signed cert)
- update client to use SSL for proxy connection (may need to force acceptance of a self-signed cert)
- Use threads to handle simultaneous clients
- add test for rejecting non-proxy connections
- Listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP 1080

## pie-in-the-sky goals
- some kind of actual SSL cert (let's encrypt, DNS, VPS, ...)
- do more searching for existant HTTP parsing libraries? May be nice for something more compliant
- explore an event-based way to handle established tunnels. Either a third-party library or some
internal thing I don't know about. Would probably be nicer than a while(true) loop
- add auth header for proxy request, to cut down on low-effort (but low impact) abuse

#### dev log
- Spent some time pre-project brushing up on Java and Gradle
- First few hours were getting a basic giphy test client, putting a basic
skeleton in place, and getting something barely functional working.
- Next session was big code refactor
