Basic http tunneling proxy for giphy api.

# Usage

Run the project with `./gradlew run` from the root of the project. It will
listen on port 1080 for proxy requests. Test with the `test-giphy.sh` script.

# Dependencies

Developed for Java 8, using openjdk version "1.8.0_252".
tested with curl 7.52.1.

# TODO
- Listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP 1080
- Add unit tests where possible
- Add more thorough testing & stress testing (not pointing at giphy)

## pie-in-the-sky/next step goals
- a real SSL cert (let's encrypt, DNS, VPS, ...)
- evaluate HTTP parsing libraries for suitability
- evaluate event-based networking libraries to refactor pipeline/thread code
- add auth header for proxy request, to cut down on low-effort (but low impact) abuse
- careful/restricted logging to monitor performance, log unexpected crashes
- Audit code for Java best practices, checking for null, possible DoS, etc.
- investigate thread management to prevent/monitor resource exhaustion

#### dev log
- Spent some time pre-project brushing up on Java and Gradle
- First few hours were getting a basic giphy test client, putting a basic
skeleton in place, and getting something barely functional working.
- Next session was big code refactor to use separate classes, make things more readable
- Last session was refactoring to use threads, properly detecting closed connections and cleaning up for them, and using SSL for the proxy connection. With some final code cleanup
